# Crazyflie link implementation for rust

This repos contains an experimental implementation of the Crazyflie radio link in Rust as well as a python binding for it.

It allows to scan for Crazyflies and to open a safe bidirectional radio connection using a Crazyradio.

Look at and run the [examples](crazyflie-link/examples) to understand the current state of the link. Implementeation is still in progress.
